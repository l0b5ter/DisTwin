# DisTwin

DisTwin is a frame which enables cross communication between bots, mainly twitch and discord bots. Thats not all it allows you to see both bot outputs in one window, along with bot management.

It comes with a twitch and discord bot that can be installed and edited while in this program. These bot doesnt need you to restart whenever you add/edit/remove a command, just do [prefix]reload to load in all the commands. So no more downtime!!!!!

The fantastic about these bots is that when a command doesnt work, it will give you a error and load in every command except the failed one. So you dont have to be worried about a command that will not work or even worse, crash the bot.

Twitch bot comes with reedem point handling, setting up a reedemable reward will allow the bot to trigger a event.
The bot also can click keys on your keyboard, so let your chat mess with you and automatically press a key on your keyboard. This function work with reedem points and commands, but to let it work with commands you MUST enable the bot currency!

Both bots comes with option to work with a common currency, which can be enabled in the program.

Wanna use your already existing bot? No worries, just move or change the bot path. Read below to get more info.
